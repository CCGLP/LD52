      are starting to take an interest in fighting for their rights, although it

    - I am going to talk to the new hires in HR today to discuss their working conditions,

      industry depresses me greatly.

    - Today I had a job interview where the boss confessed to me that they are going
      to fire one of my future coworkers soon, but they have him on staff because
      his salary is cheap. I can't stand these people.
  - list:
    - At this month's job interview I was offered a salary below minimum wage working
      12 hours a day. I hate my life
  - list:
    - I am thinking of leaving the country to obtain better working conditions. I
      keep coming across illegal job offers and the government doesn't seem to want
      to do anything about it.
